	<h2>Reflection</h2>
	<p>Creating Awesome Game was a difficult and frustrating task. Many times when we would try to fix some of the errors in our game we would create other errors in attempt to solve others. Mainly when adding difficulty to the game we experiance problems that would make the game completely unplayable. A difficult part of making a game is thinking of the ways you can create actions in the game using code. We had to get creative and use many different codes to make the game function smoothly. </p>
